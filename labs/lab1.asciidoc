== Install Git and frontends
[[install-git]]

Mac OS X:: http://rowanj.github.io/gitx/[Install GitX-dev].
+
NOTE: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/[XCode developer tools] ships with git; otherwise, http://git-scm.com/download/mac[install the latest git from here].

Linux:: http://git-scm.com/download/linux[Install git] using your package manager. http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/[QGit, a git frontend] may also be available for your distribution.
+
NOTE: Don't forget to use +sudo+ with your package manager.

== Setup your course repository
[[setup-repo]]
IMPORTANT: You must use LeopardSecure, not LeopardGuest.

All platforms:: Paste this into your terminal (Git Bash on Windows):
+
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawrancej/COMP310-2014/master/starter-upper.sh | bash
----
+
NOTE: Press +Insert+ to paste in Git Bash.

== Pretest / Git practice

IMPORTANT: If you use Windows, first download and install
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html[a proper text editor]
(Notepad, Word and WordPad do not count). 

Answer this question:

What do you already know about data structures?

Take a look at the practice midterm in the exams folder.

Create a new text file in your COMP310-2014 folder called practice.txt. In that
file, write a sentence or two about what (if anything) you'd like to learn in
this class. Save your work.

Next, stage, commit and push our stuff off to ensure git is working. You can
also use Git Extensions to do this.

----
cd ~/COMP310-2014               # Go into your folder
git add practice.txt            # Stage practice.txt (include in next commit)
git commit -m "Git practice"    # Commit changes with a message
git push origin master          # Send work to your private repository
----
